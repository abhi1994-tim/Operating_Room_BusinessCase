# Operating_Room_BusinessCase

Problem statement:

Operating room (OR) inefﬁciency is a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden on healthcare
organizations, impacting both cost and patient care. While booked OR time represents a
planned utilization metric, it often deviates from the actual time procedures take due to
workﬂow delays, inaccurate booking estimates, and cancellations. This project aims to
leverage a dataset containing surgical timestamps throughout the OR workﬂow to identify
and quantify these areas of inefﬁciency. By analyzing this data, we can develop actionable
insights to optimize OR utilization, potentially saving healthcare organizations substantial
time and ﬁnancial resources, and ultimately improving patient care delivery.
